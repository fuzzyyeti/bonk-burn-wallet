# Bonk Burn Wallet
BE CAREFUL WITH THIS SERVICE! 

It swaps SOL into an SPL token using the Orca SDK, then burns it. The value of the SOL is completely unrecoverable.

You can deploy this on a server, then point a helius.xyz TRANSFER enhanced webhook to the URL. You will need a keypair of a wallet with a small amount of SOL for transaction fees. Be careful to fund it before turning on the script, because any SOL sent to this account will be swapped and burned.

Why would I want to do this? A token was launched on Christmas of 2022 intended to revive the Solana community. The community is working together to burn the token in fun ways. It's for the culture and it is to decrease the supply of the token. A service similar to this is deployed to burn royalties from the Bubble Burn NFT collection.
